Sometimes Red, Sometimes Blue using the SFML
============================================

A desktop GUI implementation of Sometimes Red, Sometimes Blue written in C++ using [SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)](http://sfml-dev.org/).

## Building

A make file is provided for building on Linux:

    $ cd SometimesRedSometimesBlue/Mono/
    $ make

The source code for this implementation is cross platform but it will need to be compiled separately for each OS/processor architecture combination.

## Todo

This implementation is still not complete. The following still needs to be done:

* Open a SFML window with background set to red or blue
* Build on Windows
