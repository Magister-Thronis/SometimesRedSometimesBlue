Sometimes red, sometimes blue with git
======================================

Ok, this one is really stupid idea. Basically the script writes either "Red" or "Blue" to `output.txt` and then commits it to a git repository.

Once I write this silly script, I'll probably run it a few times and push the results. Of course if you're reading this, then that has probably already happened.
