Sometimes Red, Sometimes Blue randomness tests
==============================================

Randomness tests in a few different languages. Don't mistake this code as a serious test of randomness, I just wrote one because I was mildly curious about what the result would be and wrote the other two so the first wouldn't feel alone.

Sometime Red, Sometimes blue does not require truly random numbers anyway.
